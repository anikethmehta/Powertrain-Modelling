# Powertrain Modelling of BEV(Battery Electric Vehicle) using Simulink
## What is Powertrain ?
## ***It's an interconnected system of components that work together to move a vehicle.***
## Components used in Powertrain are:- 
## ***Battery -> Inverter -> Motor -> Wheels***
## ***Additional components: Depending on the specific BEV model, there may be other components like a DC-DC converter, auxiliary battery, and various sensors.***
